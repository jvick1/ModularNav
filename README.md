# ModularNav
The modular navigation bar in Nav.html includes dynamic dropdown menus and can be easily integrated into various pages by loading it with jQuery. It requires the Metro UI CSS library to be included and initialized for the dropdown functionality to work correctly.

## Overview

This repository contains two HTML files: `Nav.html` and `index.html`. The `Nav.html` file defines the modular navigation bar with dropdown menus for easy integration, while the index.html file serves as the home page, dynamically loading the navigation bar using jQuery to create a seamless user interface.

The main idea here is Nav.html can be added to a central location and all your pages throughout your website can reference it.
