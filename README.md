# Modular
This repository contains modular HTML files: `Nav.html`, 'Footer.html', and `index.html`. The `Nav.html` file defines the modular navigation bar with dropdown menus for easy integration. The `Footer.html` provides an outline for a company's contact info and map/image with your location. The `index.html` file serves as the home page, dynamically loading the navigation bar using jQuery to create a seamless user interface.

## Nav
The modular navigation bar in `Nav.html` includes dynamic dropdown menus and can be easily integrated into various pages by loading it with jQuery. It requires the Metro UI CSS library to be included and initialized for the dropdown functionality to work correctly.

The main idea here is Nav.html can be added to a central location and all your pages throughout your website can reference it. 

## Footer
The modular footer in `Footer.html` provides a starting point the provide users info on your contact & location.
